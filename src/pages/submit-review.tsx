Our first night we noticed a large drain gnat above the bathroom door I noted but didn't make a big deal about it. Later on we started to notice fruit flies and other peski flying insects that became a nuisance but dealt with it for the evening. The following day my daughter found an insect crawling in her clothes that she had stored in the hotels dresser. We filed a complaint with the manager on duty, (Isma) and had a front desk clerk move us to a different room that unfortunately had the same issues. Isma promised she would follow up with me on her finding and a resolution to my complaint but never did. Issues we encountered included bugs in both the bathroom and guest room furniture, a dirty towel and subpar room cleaning services. Staff at the hotel was friendly but we were not happy with the services provided. I found it to be unprofessional the Hilton London Metropole didn't offer a resolution for our ongoing issues. They did however write an apology note and give me a bowl of fruit and juice!?";
